# Using the Pytest testing framework

The following repo contains a small python application called "Nutrition Calculator".
This app contains some basic functions that a larger, more functional app like "MyFitnessPal" would contain, but will be used as an example codebase for utilizing the features of the Pytest testing framework.

## How to run the test cases

```bash
cd nutrition_calculator\
pytest
```
